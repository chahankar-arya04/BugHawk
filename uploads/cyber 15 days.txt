Absolutely Arya! Let’s begin with the **theory** in simple language and **then move to Day 1 prerequisites**.

## 🔐 **Project: SecuriLogX – Real-Time Log Monitor & Vulnerability Auditor**

### 🎯 What is this project?

This is a **cybersecurity learning + demo project** where you’ll:

1. **Build a small website** using Python Flask (a login/signup page, dashboard).
2. **Intentionally add security flaws** (like SQL injection, XSS).
3. **Test and detect attacks** using:

   * Logs (simulating a Security Operations Center role)
   * Tools (like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP)
4. **Fix the vulnerabilities** with secure coding.
5. **Generate a PDF security report** just like in real-world jobs.

## 🧠 Why this project is powerful:

| What You Learn      | Skill Demonstrated                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Web app development | Flask, HTML                           |
| Common attacks      | OWASP Top 10: SQLi, XSS, CSRF         |
| Detection           | Log analysis (like a SOC analyst)     |
| Manual testing      | Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP                 |
| Secure coding       | Input validation, prepared statements |
| Documentation       | CVSS score, security report           |

This one project touches **every basic cybersecurity concept** in a simple way – great for **internships, placements, or resume**.

## 📂 Project Setup Steps (Summary for Day 1)

1. Create project folder `SecuriLogX`
2. Set up virtual environment `venv`
3. Install Flask
4. Create basic homepage (Flask + HTML)
5. Run the app (`python run.py`) and check in browser
